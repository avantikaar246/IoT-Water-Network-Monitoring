# Potential Improvements for IoT Water Network Monitoring

1. **Advanced Anomaly Detection**
   - Use machine learning models to detect complex anomalies in pressure and flow data.

2. **Real-Time Monitoring**
   - Integrate with a live data pipeline to monitor sensor readings in real time.

3. **Data Normalization**
   - Standardize readings across vendors automatically for better integration.

4. **Additional Metrics**
   - Include temperature, valve status, and water quality for a more comprehensive network health analysis.

5. **Interactive Dashboards**
   - Create dashboards using Plotly or Dash for dynamic visual exploration.

6. **Predictive Analytics**
   - Forecast pressure or flow issues using historical data and trend analysis.
